  {
    id: 'bio-11-3-8',
    question: 'What is genetic drift?',
    options: ['Directed evolution', 'Random changes in allele frequencies', 'Natural selection', 'Mutation rate'],

  // Hard Questions
  {
    id: 'bio-11-3-9',
    question: 'What is the difference between convergent and divergent evolution?',
    options: ['No difference', 'Convergent: similar traits in unrelated species; Divergent: different traits from common ancestor', 'Convergent is slower', 'Divergent creates identical species'],
    correct: 'Convergent: similar traits in unrelated species; Divergent: different traits from common ancestor',
    explanation: 'Convergent evolution produces similar traits in unrelated species, while divergent evolution produces different traits from a common ancestor.',

  },
  {
    id: 'bio-11-3-10',
    question: 'What is the Hardy-Weinberg principle?',
    options: ['Evolution is constant', 'Populations evolve randomly', 'Allele frequencies remain constant under specific conditions', 'Mutations are beneficial'],
    correct: 'Allele frequencies remain constant under specific conditions',
    explanation: 'The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele frequencies remain constant in a population under specific conditions (no mutation, migration, selection, etc.).',
