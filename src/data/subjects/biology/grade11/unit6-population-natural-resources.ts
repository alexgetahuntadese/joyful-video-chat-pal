    id: 'bio-11-6-3',
    question: 'Which is an example of a renewable resource?',
    options: ['Coal', 'Oil', 'Solar energy', 'Natural gas'],
    correct: 'Solar energy',
    explanation: 'Solar energy is renewable because it is continuously replenished by the sun and will not run out.',

    id: 'bio-11-6-4',
    question: 'What happens when a population exceeds its carrying capacity?',
    options: ['Population continues growing', 'Population stabilizes', 'Population may crash', 'Nothing happens'],
    correct: 'Population may crash',
    explanation: 'When a population exceeds carrying capacity, resources become limited, leading to increased mortality and potential population crash.',

  // Medium Questions
  {
    id: 'bio-11-6-6',
    question: 'What factors limit population growth?',
    options: ['Only food availability', 'Food, space, disease, and predation', 'Only weather', 'Only human activity'],
    correct: 'Food, space, disease, and predation',
    explanation: 'Population growth is limited by various factors including food availability, living space, disease, predation, and environmental conditions.',

    topic: 'Resource Types'
  },
  {
    id: 'bio-11-6-8',
    question: 'What is sustainable development?',
    options: ['Using resources without limits', 'Meeting current needs without compromising future generations', 'Stopping all development', 'Only economic growth'],
    correct: 'Meeting current needs without compromising future generations',
    explanation: 'Sustainable development meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.',
